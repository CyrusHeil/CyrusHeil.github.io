<div="Best places in Belize to visit>
<p> In my opinion Belize is amazing overall, but there are locations that are superior. If you would like a mix of city and rainforest then you should go to San Ignacio. If you want see the ocean and go snorkeling you should visit any of the Cayes but I would recommend Caye Caulker.
